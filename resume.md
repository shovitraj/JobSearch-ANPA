# Guide: AI Prompts to Fix Your Resume Based on Skills

This guide contains specific prompt protocols designed to extract, refine, and prove your skills on your resume using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).

---

## Phase 1: The "Skill Extraction" (Finding what you actually do)
**Goal:** Use this if you feel your resume is too generic or you aren't sure what your "top" skills are.

> **The Prompt:**
> "I am going to paste my resume below. Please act as a Career Coach. Analyze my experience and list the top 10 **Hard Skills** (technical) and top 5 **Soft Skills** (interpersonal) that are evident in my work history. For each skill, point out which specific bullet point proves I have that skill."

> **[Paste Resume Here]**

## Phase 2: The "Quantifier" (Proving your skills)
**Goal:** Turn "I did this task" into "I achieved this result."

> **The Prompt:**
> "I am pasting a bullet point from my resume below. It focuses too much on *duties* and not enough on *impact*. Please rewrite this bullet point using the **'X-Y-Z Formula'** (Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]). Make the skill of **[Insert Skill, e.g., Project Management]** obvious in the rewrite."

## Phase 3: The "ATS Matcher" (Beating the robot)
**Goal:** Use this when you are applying for a specific role and want to ensure you pass the initial screen.

> **The Prompt:**
> "I am pasting my current Resume and a Target Job Description below.
> 1. Extract the top 15 keywords/skills from the Job Description.
> 2. Cross-reference them with my Resume.
> 3. Create a table showing: 'Matched Skills', 'Missing Skills', and 'Skills I have but phrased differently'.
> 4. Suggest a sentence to add to my 'Professional Summary' that incorporates 3 of the missing keywords naturally."
>
> **[Paste Resume]**
> **[Paste Job Description]**

---

## Phase 4: The "Level Up" (Sounding more senior)
**Goal:** Use this if your skills look too junior (e.g., "helped with," "assisted").

> **The Prompt:**
> "Review the 'Experience' section of my resume below. Identify instances where I use passive language or weak verbs (like 'helped,' 'responsible for,' or 'worked on'). Rewrite these bullet points to sound more executive and authoritative using strong action verbs (like 'Orchestrated,' 'Spearheaded,' or 'Optimized') to highlight my leadership skills."
>
> **[Paste Resume Experience Section]**

---

## Phase 5: The Pivot (Transferable Skills)
**Goal:** Use this if you are changing industries (e.g., moving from Sales to Customer Success).

> **The Prompt:**
> "I am currently a **[Current Role]** looking to transition into a **[Target Role]**. Analyze my resume below. Identify my 'Transferable Skills'—skills I currently have that are highly relevant to the new role. Rewrite my 'Professional Summary' to frame my past experience specifically through the lens of the **[Target Role]**, minimizing jargon from my old industry."
