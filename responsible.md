# IBM Responsible AI: Principles and Pillars

*A summary of IBM's framework for building and deploying trustworthy artificial intelligence.*

## 1. Core Principles for Trust
IBM's approach is built on three fundamental beliefs:
- **Augmenting Human Intelligence:** AI's purpose is to make people better at their jobs and benefit society as a whole.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Client data and insights belong exclusively to the client.
- **Explainability:** Technology must be transparent; users should know how an AI arrived at a recommendation.

## 2. The Five Pillars of Trust
To put principles into practice, IBM focuses on five key technical and ethical areas:
1. **Explainability:** Providing reasons for AI-driven outcomes.
2. **Fairness:** Detecting and mitigating bias in datasets and models.
3. **Robustness:** Protecting AI from adversarial threats and ensuring system stability.
4. **Transparency:** Openly sharing information about how the AI was built and tested.
5. **Privacy:** Ensuring personal data is protected throughout the AI lifecycle.

## 3. Strategic Governance
IBM manages its ethical commitments through:
- **Responsible Technology Board:** An internal body that provides standards for AI and emerging tech like Quantum.
- **watsonx.governance:** A technical platform designed to simplify compliance and automate responsible AI workflows.
- **AI Alliance:** A partnership with Meta and 50+ members to promote open, safe AI innovation.
